1. What is typescript ?
- Typescript is a super set of javascript.
- Detect error in the code without running it.
- it needs to be converted to JS to run.
- The compilation process remove all the types.

2. What is Infer types (implicit types)? 
- Types that typescript automatically recognize type without the need of specifying it
eg ; let userName = 'ajmal';
     userName = 0;    ie, there will be an error says number cannot be assigned to string


3. What is Defining Type (Explicit types) ?
- Types that we explicitly specifying 

some examples are : - 
   - let userName2 : string = "ajmal ea";

   - let phone_number : number = 87654321;
    
   - let skills : string[] = ['html','css','js','ts'];
    
   - let count : number[] = [1,2,3,4];
    
   - let emptyArray : [] = [];
    
   - let userDetail : {name:string,age:number} = {
        name:"ajmal",
        age:22
    }


4 . What is Interface ? 

- when declaring objects if there is lot more properties present in the object we have to mention in the type.
- and the second condition is if there is same amount of same properties there in another object . 
- we can specify the properties in interface . and reuse in both objects.

- interface is a way to define structure of an object.
- ensure that object follow specific format by specifying properties and their types.

interface Details {
    name:string;
    age:number;
    salary:number;
}

let employeeDetails : Details = {
    name:"employee1",
    age:20,
    salary:100000
}
let managerDetails : Details = {
    name:"ajmal",
    age:22,
    salary:1000000
}



5. UNION operator ( string | number )

type DetailsType = {
    name:string,
    age:number | string,
    salary:number,
}

- here by mentioning union operator in age . we can give age in either string or phone_number.

6.how to specify that the array contains multiple types ?

- let array : (string|number|boolean)[]=[1,2,3,"string1",true]


7.  age:number|string;    // UNION   - we can insert either number or string . just like or operator
    salary?:number;     //OPTIONAL  - these fields are optional . even if we omit there will be no error


8 . HOw can we define type for functions ?

    function getUserName (userDetail : DetailsType) : string {      => here were are mentioning the string to specify that the function return string datatype
        return userDetail.name;
    }

    getUserName(userDetail)
